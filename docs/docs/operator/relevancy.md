# Vulnerability relevancy

The relevancy feature of the Kubescape operator enables users to understand which vulnerabilities detected by [the vulnerability scanner](vulnerabilities.md) are likely to be relevant, based on evaluation at runtime.

Kubescape's relevancy filtering is implemented by an [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/) program on each node, deployed using the [node agent](index.md#node-agent). It scans the running environment and maps out artifacts and libraries that are loaded into memory and therefore are in use in the environment.

Using eBPF probes, it looks at the file activity of a running container. When a pod starts on a node, the node agent will watch its containers for a configurable learning period and store an activity log.

During the process of scanning a container, an SBOM is generated. This contains the vulnerability scannerâ€™s understanding of which components are installed in the container. When vulnerabilities are checked, the engine is provided with a filtered SBOM, including the packages that relate to files that were accessed during the learning period.


## Enabling relevancy

Relevancy is installed by default when installing the Kubescape operator through Helm.  You must have a node that supports eBPF.

!!! note Note
    Relevancy does not work on Minikube or Docker Desktop.

The durations for how long the node agent will observe a running container are configured with the `nodeAgent.config` values in the Helm installation:

```
nodeAgent:
  config:
    maxLearningPeriod: 3h 
    learningPeriod: 2m
    updatePeriod: 10m
```

## Using the Relevancy feature

After installation, the node agent will start listening for every **new** or **restarted** container for the time configured in the learning period. Once the learning period concludes, the relevancy information will be available in the [in-cluster storage](index.md#in-cluster-storage) and sent to a configured [provider](../providers.md). The node agent will keep listening for the container until the maxLearningPeriod is reached.

### View relevancy information

Counts of relevant vulnerabilties are available in the [vulnerability summary objects](vulnerabilities.md#vulnerabilty-summaries). The [vulnerability manifest](vulnerabilities.md#vulnerabilty-manifests) will show whether a given CVE was found relevant or not.

The full and filtered SBOM objects are stored in the `kubescape` namespace. View the labels to get the information as to which image and parent object the SBOM relates to.

## Limitations

### Linux kernel

The relevancy functionality is based on eBPF, which is currently only implemented on Linux. This feature will not work on Windows. The kernel version on the node must be >= 4.14.

!!! info Info
    The node agent uses the [Inspektor Gadget](https://www.inspektor-gadget.io/) library.

### Symlinks

The eBPF probes used by Kubescape do not report on the actual file when a symlink is opened, meaning relevant files opened by symlink may cause CVEs to appear as not relevant.  This may result in false positives.
